write a brief introduction describing what the current project is and what skills you will have demonstrated once you have completed it. (You can also do this as a self-reflection at the end of the project, which is a good way to review what you have learned.)

This project is a recipes site similar to Allrecipies. It contains a main homepage with links to each of the recipe pages. The skills demonstrated in this project are:

1. Creating a public repository for this project on GitHub.com called odin-recipes.

2. Moving that repository onto my local machine using SHH.

3. Creating files within the repository, README.md, index.html, lasagna.html, and launching vscode from within the shell terminal. 

4. Committing using git add + git commit, early and often, every time I make a meaningful change in the code, to create a timeline of my progress, and including meaningful commit messages. 

5. Creating the initial structure of a webpage, boilerplate HTML, title, headings, etc.

6. Creating another directory within the odin-recipes directory, to contain the multiple pages of recipes, and linking them to index.html. 

7. Adding images, paragraphs and lists, both ordered and unordered. 

8. Pushing my completed work and all of the committed files up to GitHub using git push origin main.

9. Publishing my web project on GitHub.
