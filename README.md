This project is a recipe site similar to Allrecipies. It contains a main homepage with links to each of the three recipe pages I made. The skills demonstrated in this project are:

Creating a public repository for this project on GitHub.com called odin-recipes.

Moving that repository onto my local machine using SHH.

Creating and navigating directories and files in the repository, as well as launching Vscode from within the shell terminal.

Using the Git workflow, committing early and often, every time I make a meaningful change in the code, to create a timeline of my progress, including meaningful, clear and concise commit messages using best practices. 

Creating the initial structure of a webpage, boilerplate HTML, title, headings, proper indentation, etc.

Creating another directory within the odin-recipes directory, to contain the multiple pages of recipes, and linking them to index.html. 

Working with images, creating another directory to contain the images and linking them to their respective html files. Working paragraphs and lists, both ordered and unordered. 

Pushing my completed work and all of the committed files up to GitHub.
